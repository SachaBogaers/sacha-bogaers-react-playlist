			<h2>About this project</h2>
			<p>Hi! Thanks for visiting my Playlist project. I built this project while I was following the Winc Academy Curriculum. It was built using React.js (as well as HTML and CSS, of course).</p>
			<p>My name is Sacha Bogaers and I am 25 years old. I like cats, cows, tea, wine, chips, programming, inclusion and all kinds of other things :) </p>
